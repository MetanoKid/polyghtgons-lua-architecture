		tutorial01_04 = "This one is a cubic-headed blue Polyghtgon.",
		tutorial01_05 = "Every level's goal consists on taking every Polyghtgon to the exit. Want to know what an exit is?",
		tutorial01_06 = "This door is an exit. Every exit has an inner shape which matches with Polyghtgons'. That signboard over there is a hint, too!",
		tutorial01_07 = "So, let's move! First of all you've got to select the Polyghtgon. Left click on it and the Polyghtgon will be outlined. Try it!",
		tutorial01_08 = "Great job! Now, let's take him to the exit!",
		tutorial01_09 = "Tell him to move by clicking the hexagon you want to move to. Left click, right click? We've got you covered! Try it now!",

		tutorial02_05 = "So let's see, do we have any red Polyghtgon around?",
		tutorial02_06 = "Yes! We've got a red Polyghtgon, just what we needed! Lucky, huh? Left click him then!",
		tutorial02_07 = "Nice! When a Polyghtgon is light up it will use its color, and which hexagons are light up depend on its head.",
		tutorial02_08 = "This is a spherical-headed red Polyghtgon, and that means it will light up every hexagon around him.",
		tutorial02_09 = "Enough chit-chat! Left click him again to light him up!",
		tutorial02_10 = "Good job! Now the lever has been activated and there's a new way to the exit!",
		tutorial02_11 = "Remember: Polyghtgons have limited energy. If you keep them light up, they may use it all. Turn them off if you don't need it anymore.",
		tutorial02_12 = "That's it for now, tell him to go to the exit door!",

		tutorial03_01 = "Hey, it looks like you're enjoying your journey of discovery! Let's learn more stuff about this universe!",
		tutorial03_02 = "This is a color door. Each one of them has an associated color. Wonder how to open them, huh?",
		tutorial03_03 = "Yes, you were right: only Polyghtgons with the same color can pass through them!",
		tutorial03_04 = "Doors will open and close automatically as soon as you approach them, so you don't need to interact with them manually.",
		tutorial03_05 = "So, why don't you select that Polyghtgon and tell him to go to an hexagon past the door? (psst: click the hexagon you want to move to)",
		tutorial03_06 = "Good job! There are as many color doors as colors exist in Polyghtgons. You might even have to fuse Polyghtgons!",
		tutorial03_07 = "This is a white door, and thus we need a white Polyghtgon... but we don't have any. This time, we'll have to find a way around.",
		tutorial03_08 = "Polyghtgons are clever people, and they can find a route to an hexagon. Try moving to the exit by clicking exit's hexagon!",

		tutorial05_02 = "However we can't harm them. Do what we do, Neo: run and don't look back.",
		tutorial05_03 = "First things first. Remember what levers do and how to activate them? (psst: light it up with its color)",
		tutorial05_04 = "Alright, so here we are. We've saved the game, just in case that Shadow touches you. You're welcome.",
		tutorial05_05 = "Shadows are really dangerous: they can see you while moving and they will go after you until you get away from them!",
		tutorial05_06 = "Even if they don't see you, they can perceive light if its too close to them. Be careful if you light up with a Shadow around.",
		tutorial05_07 = "So you are ready to run for your life to the exit. Just don't let him enter your hexagon. Ready? Set? Go!",

		tutorial06_03 = "This puzzle is about playing a pattern in an order. That gramophone will tell you which pattern. Why don't you move into it?",
		tutorial06_04 = "Okay, so our pattern is Green, Blue, Red. Now you've got to play it yourself. How, you ask?",
		tutorial06_05 = "See those microphones? All of them are listening to you. You can light them up with colors to play the pattern.",
		tutorial06_06 = "So, try it yourself. Remember, this pattern is Green, Blue, Red.",
		tutorial06_07 = "Awesome! You've got some skills, there!",
		tutorial06_08 = "So, that's the exit. This time you just need to bring one Polyghtgon. Keep an eye on its shape.",

		tutorial07_01 = "Howdy! Still in search of knowledge? We've got more stuff for you then!",
		tutorial07_02 = "Look, a sprout! Although we just see its cocoon, there's one inside. Trust me!",
		tutorial07_03 = "What's its color? Alright, so we need to light it up with its color so it grows up. Why don't you try it?",
		tutorial07_04 = "Great job! Now you can climb it up to reach a higher hexagon. Just click the highest hexagon next to the sprout.",
		tutorial07_05 = "Nice! Now you've learned how to use colors, let's try to solve this puzzle.",
		tutorial07_06 = "This is a color pattern, you have to clone its colors in other place. Where is that?",
		tutorial07_07 = "See these rocky hexagons, surrounded by leaves? That's where.",
		tutorial07_08 = "Cubic-headed Polyghtgons light up the hexagon they're on, the one in front of them and the last three he was standing on while light up.",
		tutorial07_09 = "So, try it now: light yourself up, then move and try to clone the pattern! While light up you will stay facing the same direction!",
		tutorial07_10 = "You're awesome! Great job! Now go to the exit door!",

		tutorial08_08 = "To go through this door, you must have a spherical head. Check door's inner shape!",
		tutorial08_09 = "However, your red Polyghtgon has a cubic head, aww. Let's find a way to get a spherical head!",
		tutorial08_10 = "Hey, that green Polyghtgon is what we need! You can exchange heads with other Polyghtgon using the Head Exchanger.",
		tutorial08_11 = "To exchange heads, move each Polyghtgon into a Head Exchanger and let it do its work. Your turn now!",
